## Why not add these in the Arch Linux User Repository?
- I had to switch back to Windows due to various reasons so I can't always maintain and update them (I hope I can go back to daily-driving Arch once those reasons go away)
- I don't know why, but I don't feel confident enough to do so

## Packages does NOT include development files (libraries, headers, things you need for development)
The packages here only installs the program and that's it, __it does NOT install things like development libraries or headers__, heres alternative(s) if you need a package and also need those development headers or libraries:
- Luau - use https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/luau
